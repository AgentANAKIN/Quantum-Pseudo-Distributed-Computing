# Quantum-Pseudo-Distributed-Computing
You can't actually apply multi-qubit gates across devices, so this is "pseudo-distributed" because it simulates having more qubits available than you actually do.
<p>This code is based on my <a href='https://agentanakinai.wordpress.com/2019/10/12/updated-quantum-true-random-number-generator/'>Quantum True Random Number Generator (TRNG)</a>. Refer to the article and its associated GitHub code for comments regarding true random number generation.
